# Calculator app (Android)


*   This is a functional calculator app for Android, built using Kotlin and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. 
*   It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and sign change.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Sign Change:**  Changes the sign of the current number. (`+/-`)
*   **Clear/Delete:**
    *   `AC`: Clears the entire equation and result.
    *   `C`: Deletes the last entered character.
*   **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" if a calculation error occurs, preventing app crashes.
*   **MVVM Architecture:**  Improves code organization, testability, and maintainability by separating concerns.
  

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
*   **Android SDK:** The software development kit for building Android applications.
*   **Android Architecture Components:** Specifically, LiveData and ViewModel are used to manage UI-related data and the UI lifecycle.

## How to Use

1.  **Input:** Use the number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to enter your mathematical expression.  
2.  **Calculate:** Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
3.  **Clear:**
    *   Press the "AC" button to clear the entire display (the equation and the result).
    *   Press the "C" button to delete the last entered character.
4.  **Sign Change:** Press the "+/-" button to change the sign (positive to negative, or negative to positive) of the current number in the display.
